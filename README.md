# E-lost-and-found

## Tagline
"Trust on a way"

## Problem Statement
Traditional lost and found systems are inefficient and inconvenient. Items often end up in central locations, making them hard to access. Your project provides a digital platform for reporting lost items, searching, and claiming found items, making the process efficient and increasing the chances of reuniting lost items with their owners.
